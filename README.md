## Trading Interest (moved away from Python Mini Showcases)

## Update: decided to create new repo for trading algorithms, expecting it to get quite big eventually.

After my recent internship at Sumitomo Corporation, I began to read up more on commodity trading and futures trading as well. I am currently still reading up on the CME Group website, and aim to start actively trading on own account by the end of this year. Previously I was a dividend investor buying and selling equities on MooMoo, and still have holdings in there till today.

My goals for this area are mainly to create effective back-testing algorithms before I push my strategies to the trading API, which I will monitor after office hours to check for any bugs/profitability issues. I first started by coding out a barebones simple pairs trading script to check for spreads between stocks (example code I pushed is between XOM and SHEL). Then, I ventured into trying to hedge the S&P500 using macro factors like inflation rate (CPI) and Real GDP growth rates, and my interest in coding out back-testing algorithms grew from there. The code that I shared here are solely my own and not copy-pasted from GPT, Stack Overflow or any other sources.

Update Frequency for this section: Every 2 weeks optimally, during school time every month or so due to external volunteering and part-time job commitments.
